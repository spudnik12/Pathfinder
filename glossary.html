		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Term</th>
				<th>Definition</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>ACID-compliance</td>
				<td>Ensuring data accuracy and consistency through Atomicity,
					Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID) in database
					transactions. </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Cloud-based Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS)</td>
				<td>Cloud-hosted integration platforms that offer integration 
					services through virtual private clouds or hybrid cloud
					models, providing scalability and flexibility.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Column-based Database</td>
				<td>A type of NoSQL database that organizes data in cells grouped
					as columns, often used for systems requiring high write
					request volume and storage of time-series or IoT data.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Data at rest</td>
				<td>Data that is stored and not actively in motion, typically
					residing in a database or storage system for various
					purposes, including backup.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Data integration</td>
				<td>A discipline involving practices, architectural techniques, and
					tools that enable organizations to ingest, transform, 
					combine, and provision data across various data types, 
					used for purposes such as data consistency.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Data lake</td>
				<td>A data repository for storing large volumes of structured,
					semi-structured, and unstructured data in its native
					format, facilitating agile data exploration and analysis.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Data mart</td>
				<td>A subset of data warehouse designed for specific business 
					functions or user communities, providing isolated
					security and performance for focused analytics. </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Data pipeline</td>
				<td>A comprehensive data movement process that covers the entire
					journey of the data from source systems to destination
					systems, which includes data integration as a key
					component. </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Data repository</td>
				<td>A general term referring  to data that has been collected,
					organized, and isolated for business operations or data
					analysis. It can include databases, data warehouses,
					and big data stores. </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Data warehouse</td>
				<td>A central repository that consolidates data from various
					sources through the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL)
					process, making it accessible for analytics and business
					intelligence. </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Document-based Database</td>
				<td>A type of NoSQL database that stores each record and its 
					associated data within a single document, allowing 
					flexible indexing, ad hoc queries, and analytics over
					collections of documents.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>ETL process</td>
				<td>The Extract, Transform, and Load process for data integration
					involves extracting data from various sources, 
					transforming it into usable format, and loading it into
					a repository.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Graph-based Database</td>
				<td>A type of NoSQL database that uses a graphical model to
					represent and store data, ideal for visualizing, analyzing,
					and discovering connections between interconnected data
					points.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Key-value store</td>
				<td>A type of NoSQL database where data is stored as key-value pairs,
					with the key serving as a unique identifier and the value
					containing data, which can be simple or complex.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Portability</td>
				<td>The capability of data integration tools to be used in various
					environments, including single-cloud, multi-cloud, or
					hybrid-cloud scenarios, provides flexibility in deployment
					options.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Pre-built connectors</td>
				<td>Catalogued connectors and adapters that simplify connecting and
					building integration flows with diverse data sources like
					databases, flat files, social media, APIs, CRM, and ERP
					applications.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Relational databases (RDBMSes)</td>
				<td>Databases that organize data into tabular format with rows and 
					columns, following a well-defined structure and schema.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Scalability</td>
				<td>The ability of a data repository to grow and expand its 
					capacity to handle increasing data volumes and workload
					demands.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Streaming data</td>
				<td>Data that is continuously generated and transmitted in real-
					time requires specialized handling and process to
					capture and analyze.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Use cases for relational databases</td>
				<td>Applications such as Online Transaction Processing (OLTP),
					Data Warehouses (OLAP), and IoT solutions where
					relational databases excel.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Vendor lock-in</td>
				<td>A situation where a user becomes dependent on a specific
					vendor's technologies and solutions, making it challenging
					to switch to other platforms.</td>
			</tr>
